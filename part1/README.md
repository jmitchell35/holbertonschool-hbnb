### Part 1: Technical Documentation

#### Context and Objective

In this initial phase, you will focus on creating comprehensive technical documentation that will serve as the foundation for the development of the HBnB Evolution application. This documentation will help in understanding the overall architecture, the detailed design of the business logic, and the interactions within the system.

#### Problem Description

You are tasked with documenting the architecture and design of a simplified version of an AirBnB-like application, named HBnB Evolution. The application will allow users to perform the following primary operations:

1. **User Management**: Users can register, update their profiles, and be identified as either regular users or administrators.
1. **Place Management**: Users can list properties (places) they own, specifying details such as name, description, price, and location (latitude and longitude). Each place can also have a list of amenities.
1. **Review Management**: Users can leave reviews for places they have visited, including a rating and a comment.
1. **Amenity Management**: The application will manage amenities that can be associated with places.

#### Business Rules and Requirements

1. **User Entity**

  * Each user has a `first name`, `last name`, `email`, and `password`.
  * Users can be identified as administrators through a `boolean` attribute.
  * Users should be able to register, update their profile information, and be deleted.
1. **Place Entity**

  * Each place has a `title`, `description`, `price`, `latitude`, and `longitude`.
  * Places are associated with the user who created them (`owner`).
  * Places can have a **list of amenities**.
  * Places can be created, updated, deleted, and listed.
1. **Review Entity**

  * Each review is associated with a specific `place` and `user`, and includes a `rating` and `comment`.
  * Reviews can be created, updated, deleted, and listed by place.
1. **Amenity Entity**

  * Each amenity has a `name`, and `description`.
  * Amenities can be created, updated, deleted, and listed.

> 

* Each object should be uniquely identified by a ID.
* For audit reasons, the creation and update datetime should be registered for all entities.

#### **Architecture and Layers**

* The application follows a layered architecture divided into:

  * **Presentation Layer**: This includes the services and API through which users interact with the system.
  * **Business Logic Layer**: This contains the models and the core logic of the application.
  * **Persistence Layer**: This is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database.

#### **Persistence**

* All data will be persisted in a database, which will be specified and implemented in Part 3 of the project.

#### Tasks

1. **High-Level Package Diagram**

  * Create a high-level package diagram that illustrates the three-layer architecture of the application and the communication between these layers via the facade pattern.
1. **Detailed Class Diagram for Business Logic Layer**

  * Design a detailed class diagram for the Business Logic layer, focusing on the User, Place, Review, and Amenity entities, including their attributes, methods, and relationships. Ensure to include the relationships between Places and Amenities.
1. **Sequence Diagrams for API Calls**

  * Develop sequence diagrams for at least four different API calls to show the interaction between the layers and the flow of information. Suggested API calls include user registration, place creation, review submission, and fetching a list of places.
1. **Documentation Compilation**

  * Compile all diagrams and explanatory notes into a comprehensive technical document.

#### Conditions and Constraints

* The documentation must clearly represent the interactions and flow of data between the different layers of the application.
* Use UML notation for all diagrams to ensure consistency and clarity.
* The business rules and requirements outlined above must be reflected accurately in the diagrams.
* Ensure that the diagrams are detailed enough to guide the implementation phase in the next parts of the project.

## Tasks

### 0. High-Level Package Diagram
#### Objective

Create a high-level package diagram that illustrates the three-layer architecture of the HBnB application and the communication between these layers via the facade pattern. This diagram will provide a conceptual overview of how the different components of the application are organized and how they interact with each other.

#### Description

In this task, you will develop a package diagram that visually represents the structure of the application, focusing on its three main layers:

1. **Presentation Layer (Services, API):** This layer handles the interaction between the user and the application. It includes all the services and APIs that are exposed to the users.
1. **Business Logic Layer (Models):** This layer contains the core business logic and the models that represent the entities in the system (e.g., User, Place, Review, Amenity).
1. **Persistence Layer:** This layer is responsible for data storage and retrieval, interacting directly with the database.

Your diagram should clearly show the three layers, the components within each layer, and the communication pathways between them. The facade pattern should be represented as the interface through which the layers interact.

#### Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Understand the Layered Architecture**

  * Review the concept of layered architecture and how it is used to organize an application.
  * Understand the responsibilities of each layer in the context of the HBnB application.
1. **Research the Facade Pattern**

  * Familiarize yourself with the facade design pattern and how it simplifies interactions between layers by providing a unified interface.
1. **Identify Key Components**

  * Identify the key components that belong to each layer:

    * **Presentation Layer:** Services, API endpoints.
    * **Business Logic Layer:** Core models (User, Place, Review, Amenity).
    * **Persistence Layer:** Database access objects or repositories.
1. **Draft the Package Diagram**

  * Create a draft of your package diagram, showing the three layers and their components.
  * Indicate the communication pathways between layers via the facade pattern.
  * Ensure that the diagram is clear, logical, and easy to understand.
1. **Review and Refine**

  * Review your diagram to ensure that it accurately represents the application’s architecture.
  * Make any necessary adjustments to improve clarity and completeness.

### 2. Sequence Diagrams for API Calls
#### Objective

Develop sequence diagrams for at least four different API calls to illustrate the interaction between the layers (Presentation, Business Logic, Persistence) and the flow of information within the HBnB application. The sequence diagrams will help visualize how different components of the system interact to fulfill specific use cases, showing the step-by-step process of handling API requests.

#### Description

In this task, you will create sequence diagrams that represent the flow of interactions across the different layers of the application for specific API calls. These diagrams will show how the Presentation Layer (Services, API), Business Logic Layer (Models), and Persistence Layer (Database) communicate with each other to handle user requests.

You will create sequence diagrams for the following API calls:

1. **User Registration:** A user signs up for a new account.
1. **Place Creation:** A user creates a new place listing.
1. **Review Submission:** A user submits a review for a place.
1. **Fetching a List of Places:** A user requests a list of places based on certain criteria.

#### Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Understand the Use Cases**

  * Review the requirements and business logic for each of the selected API calls.
  * Understand the sequence of operations needed to fulfill each API call, from the moment a request is received by the API to the point where a response is returned to the client.
1. **Identify Key Components Involved**

  * Determine which components of the system (within each layer) are involved in handling each API call.
  * Identify the order of operations, including method calls and data exchanges between components.
1. **Design the Sequence Diagrams**

  * Begin by drafting the sequence of interactions for each API call.
  * For each diagram, start with the API call from the Presentation Layer, followed by interactions with the Business Logic Layer, and ending with operations in the Persistence Layer.
  * Clearly show the flow of messages, including method invocations, data retrieval, and processing steps.
1. **Refine and Review**

  * Review your diagrams to ensure they accurately reflect the flow of information and operations required to fulfill each API call.
  * Refine the diagrams for clarity and completeness, ensuring all relevant interactions are captured.

#### Example of a generic sequence diagram using Mermaid.js:

```
